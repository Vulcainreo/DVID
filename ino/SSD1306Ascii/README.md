Many low cost OLED displays with SSD1306 controllers are available on ebay.

SSD1306Ascii runs on Arduino AVR boards, Arduino Due and many other
Arduino style boards that have the SPI or Wire library.

Several options can be set by editing SSD1306Ascii/src/SSD1306Ascii.h.

The SSD1306Ascii library only requires a few bytes of RAM.

Here is Uno memory use for the SPI "Hello world!" example with
scrolling disabled:

Sketch uses 2928 bytes (9%) of program storage space. Maximum is 32256 bytes.

Global variables use 54 bytes (2%) of dynamic memory, leaving 1994 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2048 bytes.
